# Hiya ðŸ‘‹
I'm indideee, and I like to make software, which most of the time I don't finish.

### I mainly use
* Rust
* TypeScript
* Go
* C++

on a **2020 MacBook Air M1**

### I'm currently working on
* [maybe](https://github.com/indideee/maybe), a stack-based language inspired by monty and forth.
